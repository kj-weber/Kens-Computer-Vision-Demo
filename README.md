# Kens-Computer-Vision-Demo
A personal project showcasing my knowledge of low-level python, application design, and eventually compter vision and perception.

IMPORTANT: This software uses your webcam. The video stream is in no-way saved, shared, or even broadcasted over the internet. 
Those concerned can view how the data is passed through the demo in steady_core.py

For MAC users: make sure to click "allow" when the OS asks if I can use the camera.
If you do not own a webcam, the software will use a test image.

TO RUN:
Step 1) git clone OR simply download and unzip the repository.
Step 2) From terminal: python main.py
OR from IDE: run main.py.

It's that easy, I create your own virtual environment for you, and then download trusted public dependencies (pip installer)

Developed for, and tested on, Windows OS, and Mac OS (dual support)
